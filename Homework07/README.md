<h1>E-commerce TypeScript</h1>
<p>For this homework I used lite-server and I compilled all my TypeScript classes into one file named app.js</p>
<p>I put in this repository my entire project with node-modules, package.json and tsconfig.json</p>
<p>In src folder you can find all my TypeScript classes and in dist folder is my app.js</p>
<p>All the results from index.ts class must be in console</p>
